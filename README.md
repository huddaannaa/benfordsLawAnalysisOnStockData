## Benford's Law
### In the early 1880’s an American astronomer, Simon Newcomb published a report on the first and second digit distribution. He observed that pages he had already visited started with the number one as compared to the other pages in a logarithm table. Newcomb came up with a law which states that log (N + 1) − log(N) is equal to the probability of a leading digit N. The later years saw Frank Benford’s, a physicist who experiments on different domains using the data set of the surface area of rivers, physical constants and the sizes of populations. Benford’s successful work was credited and the discovery was named after him [36]. The law states that for any given table of statistical data which occurred due to some natural phenomena, the chances that the first digit of a randomly selected number will be one and this will have a probability of 0.301 [45]. This law is sometimes known as the first digit law, it which deals with naturally occurring entities of some real-life numerical dataset or a collection of numbers which occurred because of some natural cause [36].
